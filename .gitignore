# Model cache (Hugging Face models are usually cached elsewhere, 
# but good to be aware if any large files get generated locally)
# For example, if you had a local 'models/' directory you didn't want to push:
# models/ 

# Uploads folder (if you create one and don't want to commit test uploads)
# uploads/
